Router: Think of the router as a map for your website. It helps you decide what to show when someone goes to different parts of your website.

Routes: Routes are like roads on the map. They tell the router which parts of your website should be shown for different website addresses (URLs).

Route: A route is like a sign on a road that says, "This way to a specific place." It tells the router which part of your website to show when someone visits a particular address (URL).

Link: Links are like signposts on your website. They are clickable text or buttons that help users move from one place to another on your website without refreshing the whole page.

Outlet: An outlet is like a space on a webpage where different things can appear. It's often used to show the content related to the route you're on.

So, in simple terms, a router helps you decide what to show on your website when someone clicks on links or types in different web addresses. Routes are like directions, links help users move around, and outlets are spaces on your webpage where the content for different places can appear.
