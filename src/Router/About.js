      <h1>Router</h1>
      <p>
        The <b>Router</b> component is the root component of React Router. It
        provides the routing context for your application and enables navigation
        between different views or components based on the current URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of the router as a map for your website. It helps you decide what
        to show when someone goes to different parts of your website.
