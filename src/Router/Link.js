      <h1>Link </h1>
      <p>
        The <b>Link</b> component is used to create hyperlinks within your
        application that navigate to different routes. It allows users to click
        on links to move between different views without triggering a full page
        refresh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Links are like signposts on your website. They are clickable text or
        buttons that help users move from one place to another on your website
        without refreshing the whole page.
