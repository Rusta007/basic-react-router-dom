        The <b>Outlet</b> component is used to render the child routes of a
        parent route. It's typically used within a layout component to specify
        where the nested route components should be rendered.

        An outlet is like a space on a webpage where different things can
        appear. It's often used to show the content related to the route you're
        on.
