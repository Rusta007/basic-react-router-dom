      <h1>Route</h1>
      <p>
        The <b>Route</b> component defines a route within your application. It
        specifies a URL path and the component to render when that path is
        matched. You can also nest routes within other routes to create nested
        route layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A route is like a sign on a road that says, "This way to a specific
        place." It tells the router which part of your website to show when
        someone visits a particular address (URL).
